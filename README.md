# Volatility 2 Install Script.
A simple bash script that automates the installation of Volatility 2. This was designed to be executed within a Kali Linux VM, sourced from kali.org, and was created for a university module. It may work on other Debian-based OS however since version 1.2 this script has only been tested on Ubuntu & Kali systems (64-bit).
